# Features [`↩`](#contents) <a id="features"></a>

Activities can be displayed in list, calendar, and map views. They further can be filtered by focus, tags, level, date, and location. Future filters at greater scale will include friend involvement and affiliated organizations. Activities will also eventually be able to be related to one another, meaning one activity could be a sub, pre, or post activity for a main one.

# Disclosure

These two concepts are the guiding principles of what is and is not allowed, with their interpretation falling to and growing with the community itself.

activist is not directly affiliated with any corporations, political parties, governments or non-government organizations.
