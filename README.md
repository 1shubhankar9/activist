### An open-source, nonprofit activist network

[**activist.org**](http://activist.org/) is a network for sociopolitical action that allows people the world over to coordinate and collaborate on the issues that matter most. The current goal is the creation of a central platform to find and discover political events and organizations.

**What does the activist `a` mean?** The center of the letter represents an arrow that points towards left-center from the top - that we want to work with the left and center of the political spectrum and value a democratic movement of power down to the people.

# Platform Overview [`‚áß`](#contents)

The following sections give a general overview of the various aspects of [activist.org](http://activist.org/).

## Organizations [`‚áß`](#contents)

activist is first and foremost about organizations, with the design of the platform being tailored to their needs rather than those of individuals. The main function of organizations on activist is organizing and hosting [events](#events), but future features aim to help them achieve their goals and scale more effectively.

Organizations will eventually have the following features:

### Application

All organizations have to apply to join activist. The application process is the way that the community transparently expands, with the support for applications from organizations already on the platform serving to verify those who want to join.

### Working Groups

Working groups allow organizations to organize themselves into smaller teams for specific purposes.

### Tasks

Tasks are all the things that organizations need to do, which will be able to be organized in lists and kanban boards. Tasks can themselves be [events](#events).

### Communications

Organizations will be able to send out communications to their members (announcements) and supporters (statements).

## Events [`‚áß`](#contents)

Events are where things happen on activist. They are organized by [issue](#issues) and [level](#levels), with the former being the focus of the event, and the latter being the kind of participation that people attending should expect.

### Levels

Activism levels are the kind of involvement for the event, with each being a necessary component to progress within a given issue:

- Act
- Learn

Coloration is used to easily delineate the level of a particular event, with blue being for learning, green being for supporting, and red being for acting.

## Movements [`‚áß`](#contents)

activist includes a broad selection of movements:

|                        |                             |                            |
| :--------------------- | :-------------------------- | :------------------------- |
| Environment            | Animal Rights               | Democracy                  |
| LGTBQIA+               | Human Rights                | Women‚Äôs Rights             |
| Children‚Äôs Rights      | Elder Rights                | Racial Justice             |
| Health                 | Housing and Community       | Refugees and Migration     |
| Worker‚Äôs Rights        | Technology and Privacy      | Trade and Development      |
| Nutrition              | Accessibility and Inclusion | Emergency Relief           |
| Education              | Freedom of Expression       | Institutional Transparency |
| Substance Legalization | Peace and Resolution        | Other                      |

Beyond these general issues, tags will also be used to draw community attention to more specific issues.

## Resources [`‚áß`](#contents)

Resources at the start will aggregate links to files that organizations want to organize and present to their members and the general public (if made open). Later the goal is to allow for the creation of unique hosted resources such as maps that indicate areas of interest and presentations of statistical findings from researchers.

## Activists [`‚áß`](#contents)

Activists, user accounts, will not be included in the MVP beyond what's needed for organizations. The main goal for this component at the start is to derive technical specifications that assure that privacy at the highest level can be provided to those users who want it, while at the same time allowing for those who want to work in the open to do so. Activism is a dangerous job for many, and the platform will respect the needs of those who do dangerous work and still want to participate. Hidden accounts is the current working idea, but it should be noted that such accounts may not be fully featured.

## Affiliations [`‚áß`](#contents)

activist has various kinds of relationships between between organizations and activists that are collectively known as affiliations. The possible affiliations include:

- Supporter: an organization or activist that supports another
- Ally: the relationship of mutual support

What kind of affiliate an organization or activist is will determine their notifications and degrees of access to private content.

## Votes [`‚áß`](#contents)

Another forthcoming feature, the Votes section would allow events to be made in relation to elections and legislation. Whether or not this section would be integrated into Events is yet to be decided. Generally the idea is that [Wikidata](https://wikidata.org) would be used as a source for votes in the various regions in which activist operates.
