### An open-source, nonprofit activist network

[**activist.org**](http://activist.org/) is a network for sociopolitical action that allows people the world over to coordinate and collaborate on the issues that matter most. The current goal is the creation of a central platform to find and discover political events and organizations.

**What does the activist `a` mean?** The center of the letter represents an arrow that points left-center from the top. This symbolizes our community and direction: that we want to work with the left and center of the political spectrum and value a democratic movement of power down to the people.

# Platform Overview [`‚áß`](#contents)

The following sections give a general overview of the various aspects of [activist.org](http://activist.org/).

## Organizations [`‚áß`](#contents)

activist is first and foremost about organizations, with the design of the platform being tailored to their needs rather than those of individuals. The main function of organizations on activist is organizing and hosting [events](#events), but future features aim to help them achieve their goals and scale more effectively.

Organizations will eventually have the following features:

### Applying to join

All organizations have to apply to join activist. The application process is the way that the community transparently expands, with the support from organizations already on the platform serving to verify those who want to join. Interactions on the platform will also in some cases be limited to members of organizations. In this way we create important links of trust from organizations to other organizations, and each organization to its individual members.

### Working Groups

Working groups will allow organizations to organize themselves into smaller teams for specific purposes.

### Communications

Organizations will be able to send out communications to their members (announcements) and supporters (statements).

### Tasks

Tasks are all the things that organizations need to do, which will be able to be organized in lists and kanban boards. Tasks can themselves be events or actions needed to make sure the event is a success (see below).

<a id="events"></a>

## Events [`‚áß`](#contents)

Events are where things happen on activist. They are organized by [movements](#movements), [levels](#levels) and [formats](#formats): the first being the focus of the event; the second being the kind of participation that people attending should expect; and the third being the specific kind of activity happening (see below).

<a id="movements"></a>

### Movements

activist will eventually include a broad selection of movements. From the start the platform will focus on a select few: `Environment`, `Housing and Community`, and `Refugees and Migration`. Further movements will be added later as interest from organizations and the community grows. The following are the working movements that activist could include:

|                        |                             |                            |
| :--------------------- | :-------------------------- | :------------------------- |
| Environment            | Animal Rights               | Democracy                  |
| LGTBQIA+               | Racial Justice              | Women‚Äôs Rights             |
| Children‚Äôs Rights      | Elder Rights                | Education                  |
| Health                 | Housing and Community       | Refugees and Migration     |
| Labor Rights           | Technology and Privacy      | Peace and Resolution       |
| Nutrition              | Accessibility and Inclusion | Institutional Transparency |
| Substance Legalization | Freedom of Expression       | Emergency Relief           |

<br/>
Beyond these general movements, tags will also be used to draw community attention to more specific issues.

<a id="levels"></a>

### Levels

Activism levels are the kind of involvement for the event, with each being a necessary component to progress within a given issue. `Act` and `Learn` are the two levels of an event on activist, with coloration being used to easily delineate the level of a particular event (red is for act and blue is for learn).

<a id="formats"></a>

### Formats

Levels are further broken down into specific formats. The available formats currently include:

- Act: protest, volunteer, organize, fundraising
- Learn: seminar, webinar, meeting, panel discussion

Formats are not required for events like movements and levels, but add an optional level of granularity to help people find what they're looking for.

## Resources [`‚áß`](#contents)

Resources at the start will aggregate links to files that organizations want to organize and present to their members and the general public (if made open). Later the goal is to allow for the creation of unique hosted resources such as maps that indicate areas of interest and presentations of statistical findings from researchers.

## Activists [`‚áß`](#contents)

Activists, user accounts, will not be included in the MVP beyond what's needed for organization management. The main goal for this component at the start is to derive technical specifications that assure that privacy at the highest level can be provided to those users who want it, while at the same time balancing features needed by the community. Activism is a dangerous job for many, and the platform will respect the needs of those who need anonymity in their work and still want to participate.

## Affiliations [`‚áß`](#contents)

activist has various kinds of relationships between organizations and activists that are collectively known as affiliations. The possible affiliations include:

- Supporter: an organization or activist that supports another
- Ally: the relationship of mutual support

What kind of affiliate an organization or activist is will determine their notifications and degrees of access to private content.

## Votes [`‚áß`](#contents)

Another forthcoming feature, the votes section would allow events to be made in relation to elections and legislation. Generally the idea is that [Wikidata](https://wikidata.org) would be used as a source for votes in the various regions in which activists operate.
