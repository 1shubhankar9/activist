# Overview [`↩`](#contents) <a id="overview"></a>

activist uses universal icons and coloration to make finding activities of a certain focus and level of action as intuitive as possible.

### Activism Focuses

activist includes a broad selection of focuses that are further granulated by tags. The current activism focuses are:

- Environment
- Animal Rights
- Racial Justice
- Women's Rights
- LGBTQIA+
- Children’s Rights
- Elder Rights
- Education
- Democracy
- Institutional Accountability
- Worker's Rights
- Refugees and Migration
- Housing and Community
- Health
- Technology and Privacy
- Accessibility and Inclusion
- Trade and Development
- Emergency Relief
- Nutrition
- Freedom of Expression
- Peace and Resolution
- Drug Legalization
- Other

### Levels of Action

Levels of action are defined and represented by the activist spectrum: cooler colors for learning about issues and organization; warmer colors for direct action to make a difference. The spectrum is circular in nature, meaning lessons learned from protests and volunteering should educate new activists and reeducate those already active.

- Purple: Panel Discussions
- Blue: Seminars
- Green: Community Meetings
- Yellow: Employment
- Orange: Petitioning
- Red: Protesting
- Pink: Volunteering

# Features [`↩`](#contents) <a id="features"></a>

# Disclosure

activist is intersectionally inclusive and not blind to economic externalities - activities on activist must be willing to account for their social and economic effects. These two concepts are the guiding principles of what is and is not allowed, with their interpretation falling to and growing with the community itself.

activist is not directly affiliated with any corporations, political parties, governments or non-government organizations.
